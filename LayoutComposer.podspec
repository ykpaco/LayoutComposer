  s.description      = <<-DESC
LayoutComposer provides methods to write the typical UIView layout patterns such as:

* place UIViews along the vertical/horizontal axis. (VBox/HBox Layout)
* place child UIViews at the top|bottom|left|right|center of the parent UIView. (Relative Layout)
* make a child UIView fit the size of its parent view. (Fit Layout)

Since each layout pattern is able to contain other layout patterns as child components, you can form complicated layouts.
Auto Layout code written by LayoutComposer expresses the UIView hierarchy.
It makes Auto Layout code very simple and intuitive.
